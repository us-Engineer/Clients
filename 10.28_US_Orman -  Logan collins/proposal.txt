2 Describe your recent experience with similar projects
I recently completed electrical design and stamped construction documentation (CDs) for multiple residential projects, including new custom homes with complex power distribution and lighting circuiting requirements.

A recent project, similar in scope, involved designing for a primary residence and detached structures totaling around 7,500 square feet, where I oversaw panel placement, power service planning, and load management, meeting both local codes and energy efficiency standards. 
For each project, I ensure the design integrates seamlessly with architectural plans and facilitates coordination among disciplines.

I utilize Revit to develop detailed, accurate models and one-line diagrams to streamline the review and approval process.


3 How do you incorporate feedback and changes into your work?
I prioritize open communication with clients and design team members to ensure feedback is incorporated smoothly and efficiently. 
By implementing feedback loops at key design stages, I incorporate changes in Revit, which keeps the model up to date and consistent across all outputs.

Additionally, I’m accustomed to working closely with reviewers during the submittal review process, addressing comments swiftly while maintaining design intent and code compliance. My goal is to adapt flexibly to project needs and deliver a final design that aligns with the client’s vision and regulatory requirements.
