MacOy J Hoffman 1:42 PM
When should I deliver result?

and I have a question.

Once stamp on plan, we should secure this.

So, would you like to review and stamp only first page?

MT
MD Tenne 1:47 PM
Yes

MacOy J Hoffman 1:47 PM
Oh yes, I will follow you.

MacOy J Hoffman 1:59 PM
I am currently facing challenges in proceeding with this project. As I mentioned earlier, it is essential that all plans comply with local building codes and regulations before they are stamped. If I only stamp the first page, the city will not approve it.

MT
MD Tenne 2:00 PM
It’s just the Health department no city it’s for inspection

MacOy J Hoffman 2:08 PM
Okay, could you do this $100?

MT
MD Tenne 2:08 PM
But you said $50 a page

MacOy J Hoffman 2:09 PM

I may have something for you. We are trying to Inclose this space with sheet rock. We had planned on bracing it in the back with 2x8’s and plywood then sheet rock. We were then going to put a video wall up anchored to the 2x8’s with 2 energy sources going to it.
