Structural Engineer Needed for Pitched Roof and Skylight Design

We are seeking an experienced structural engineer to design a pitched roof with six skylights (500 pounds each) to be added to an existing wood trellis. The ideal candidate will provide detailed sketches and ensure that the design complies with all safety and building regulations. Candidates should have a solid understanding of structural integrity and experience with similar projects. Please include relevant experience in your proposal.

Hello!
I am working on the remodel of a wood trellis. I want to add a pitched roof and also add 6 skylights (each weighing 500 lbs).
Can you please confirm that the existing structure can support the added weight of the skylights and the framing members for the pitched roof. Also, can you please provide the size of the new framing members for the pitched roof?
I have an annotated as built plan that I can send. Can you provide a quote for your services?

Dear Client, thank you for invitation.

As a professional structural engineer with several years of experience in structural engineering and a track record of successfully completing similar projects, I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality design solutions that meet your requirements.

Questions to understand your requirements

1. What are the specific dimensions and pitch angle you envision for the roof?
2. Can you provide details about the existing wood trellis, including its dimensions and load-bearing capacity?
3. Are there specific brands or types of skylights you prefer, or should I recommend options based on structural requirements?
4. Are there any additional loads (snow, wind) that need to be factored into the design besides the skylights?
5. Do you have any preferences regarding the aesthetics of the roof design or the placement of the skylights?
6. What type of documentation do you require upon completion (detailed sketches, calculations, permit-ready drawings)?
7. Will there be a need for coordination with other professionals ( architects, contractors) during the design and construction phases?

*** Project Scope of the work***
1. Review the existing wood trellis structure and assess its load-bearing capacity.
2. Create a detailed design for the pitched roof, including
- Roof pitch angle and overall dimensions.
- Structural support calculations for the roof and skylights.
- Placement and specifications of six skylights (500 pounds each).
3 Ensure that all design elements comply with local building codes and safety regulations.
4. Provide detailed sketches and diagrams that illustrate
- The roof structure and its integration with the trellis.
- Skylight placement and framing details.
5. Conduct a load analysis to account for additional factors, such as
- Snow load, wind load, and any other relevant environmental considerations.
6. Prepare all necessary documentation, including
- Structural calculations.
- Permit-ready drawings for submission to local authorities.
7. Maintain communication with the client throughout the design process, providing updates and addressing any questions or concerns.
8. Allow for a specified number of revisions based on your feedback before finalizing the design.
9. Submit all final design documents, calculations, and sketches for client approval and permitting.

My expertise in structural integrity and building codes will ensure that the pitched roof and skylights are not only aesthetically pleasing but also safe and compliant with all regulations.
Looking forward to working with you!
Best regards,
MacOy H

Thank you for your questions. the attached should answer most of your questions. I need a sketch and calculations, not permitted drawings. the skylights have already been purchased. they are 500 lbs each and are 5'x8'. The only additional load would be the roofing material-which is light weight slate. Project is in California. no snow....thank you

What is the dpacing of joists?
what kind of sketch is required?

MacOy J Hoffman 6:15 PM
I can deliver result till Tuesday and budget is $1000
Please send me an offer to start working.

spacing of joists is every 11 inches. just a simple sketch that shows the size of framing required for construction, and calculations in support. $750 ok?
--------------------------------------------------
MacOy J Hoffman 7:44 PM
Okay, Cool!
Please send me $850 including upwork fee
Please send me an offer
And Middle of the joist will steel?

David Norouzi 7:49 PM
that's what I am trying to assess. do we need to beef up the existing framing to support the additional weight of the roof and skylights? If so, with what kind of framing material. I prefer to use wood products, glulam or other structural wood. not steel

Bro, I understood you are preferring the timber structure. But from structural engineering expects the structure may preferable to RCC structure framing with columns and beams and slabs no timber and steel should not be usable because 500ld X 6=3000lb , nearly 1.5 US tone and the width is 19’ and the length is 22’. For long term sustainability rcc is good enough to carry out the load in long term. On the other hand on roof those kinds of loads will not be enough for timber unless steel and rcc.
Please consider this.

you are having the existing structural framing there?
-------------------------------

David Norouzi 8:44 PM
my preference is not to demo the existing structure, but replace framing members as necessary.

MacOy J Hoffman 9:15 PM
Okay, I see
This is the sketch to be made with the dimensions mentioned?
